This program is a DirectShow Filter which can convert the frame rate using GPU, and it has the following features. Support AMD Fluid Motion Video 1; Convert 24p to 60p and 30p to 60p by interpolating frames. I know it's designed for AMD GPUs but supposedly it should work with post-Haswell Intel GPUs (according to the release notes) but I can't seem to detect my i5-7260U. Would like it as an alternative to using my TV's motion interpolation which still contains some judder. I don't want to use SVP since it uses too much CPU power.

The most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal. Every time the video (tele) part of the telecine samples the light electronically, the film (cine) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph. I love AMD Fluid Motion. It is free, and when combined with Bluesky Frame Rate Converter, watching TV shows and other videos is so much better! However, I did want to play interpolated videos on my TV, which obviously does not support AMD Fluid Motion. With SmoothVideoPlayer, you can transcode videos directly to a higher frame rate (in batch). Is there any software that supports AMD Fluid Motion and/or Bluesky Frame Rate Converter that can transcode videos to 60fps (new file)? amp#x200B;. 4 Приказом Федерального агентства по техническому регулированию и метрологии от 22 сентября  Oxelon Social Network.

I've been researching and asking around trying to find out what hardware I would need to remove screen flickering/dark bands when recording a CRT with an old camcorder. The camera is an RCA PRO854 and has no exposure/frame rate controls, and the tv is just an old relic with no control options either. Is there some sort of frame rate converter I could use to sync the TV and camera? I'm including a diagram of what we've got so far.

I didn't see any post made about using AMD's FluidMotion technology with Bluesky Frame Rate Converter ( to get ^glorious 60 FPS in movies, just some posts about SVP (https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Main_Page), so I thought I make a little tutorial here.

We are using a Sapphire Ultimate HD 7750 in our HTPC / streamer, and the wife loves the interpolated videos. I used bluesky frame rate converter with MPC to get this working. She was asking if I can do it for the other TV sets we have, so instead of buying a new TV, I was looking for another cheap no aux power video card since I already have extra old pc's that I can use. The cheapest I can find here is a 750 Ti. Do you guys know if Nvidia has something similar for AMD fluid motion.

TL;DR I cannot get Premiere Pro to export a H264 23.97fps MOV as a XDCAM HD 50 422 29.97fps MXF without distorting my audio.

Thanks! Repost because apparently it was deleted because my old title was too short. Hoping to tap the knowledge base. I work in an medical educational setting. We broadcast some lectures. These days with web based solutions. I'm working on upgrades as I'm able. We recently got a Blackmagic Web Presenter to enable us to use an external computer to webcast presentations. Taking the software off the lectern PC and whatnot. We needed a better switcher and the ability to do picture in picture and maybe some other graphics. I noted the ATEM 1 M/E can do this and my boss ordered This is my first post on this subreddit but it is very important to me and my brother. We both bought some gaming laptops in the UK while we were in University. The laptop I have: (My brother has a laptop of the same specs but a 15'' screen, will post specs if my theory is reasonable) While in the UK our laptops ran great and we were able to run all of our games at max settings and max fps (league, dota 2, etc).

I really hope someone can help me resolve this damn issue. I record all of my Let's Plays with Shadowplay. For the most part, I don't have any issues when recording with it. Every now and then, because of what I have researched thus far, the variable recording makes the audio and video not synced. In the video editor (Hitfilm) it will sometimes show itself, and sometimes it wont. I think that depends on the export settings that I end up using (which are almost always: Frame Rate: 60 Level. Hi! I'm trying to help a friend edit an interview he made with an iPhone. Hit film don't seem to support m4v so I tried to just change the file extension to mp4 but when I try to add the clip to the timeline the program just crash. Any one got a tip on what I could try? Converting or try another editor. I'm trying to render an animatic for a pilot I've been working on for months, and it's the longest project I've attempted. (13+ minutes.) I finally have it tweaked so that the audio and video are acceptable, but at key moments later in the file, the audio "drifts" from the video, ruining some timing that's very important. It only does this with the rendered file, not in the editing software itself. (AVS video editor) The AVS forum has only turned up 4+ year-old results that don't apply Earlier today I was trying to get somebody's laptop into our switcher using an AJA HA5 converter. When I plugged in the laptop, it recognized it as a monitor and the lock light lit up red to show that it had a HD signal. The problem was I was getting no output into either my switcher or a monitor. I know the thing was working earlier in the day, albeit with some issues which we believed were software related. At that point I gave up on the AJA converter and grabbed a Grass Valley So I tried connecting my 360 to my XO, but there was quite a bit of lag when playing anything fast paced. I Kind of want to try attaching my PS2 via a composite to HDMI converter. Has anyone done this, and if so, have you experienced any lag when playing games. Hi All, amp#x200B; I'm putting together a 65" TV on a cart to be used as a teaching reference display, primarily for stage use. I convert a source signal to SDI from a remote computer/switcher setup, and convert it back to HDMI at the TV. This setup will run fine for 4+ hours, however when I roll the TV just 12' over carpet (from side of stage to center) it will have momentary flicker or lose the input signal briefly. Happens \~50% of the time. amp#x200B; Anyone 
Intro: This is a full technical test of the new Battlestar dual-cell squonk mod. Not a review! Plenty of them out there already, this is all about what’s going on under the hood for those who like that stuff :) I’ll be showing the USB charge function performance, wattage performance (DC-DC converter), low-cell cutoff and standby behaviour, battery meter calibration, and doing a full dismantle with an opinion on build quality. As well as going into technical detail for the BattleSquonk. Video files work fine. It worked before update and uninstalling vlc and trying an old version does not fix it. I believe the update messed up a dvd codec (possibly for audio) or something. Media player classic plays the disk fine. I have tested with multiple disks so it is not a disk issue. I have put the entire debug output with the error replicated. To replicate the error I set playback to the middle of disk however it does not only freeze when changing playback time. Pausing So here's my current situation - I have an EOS 60D that has served me very well, and an assortment of lower-end EF-S glass (18-200, 10-18, 55-250mm) that have been fun to shoot with. I have some Canon accessories (580EX II, remote, yada yada). I think I've grown out of this setup now though, and am itching to upgrade. I also have an EOS M100 and the 22mm pancake that I bought for a trip recently - a combo I've really enjoyed, but limited in many ways (no EVF, no hotshoe). I do a wide variety. Hey all, I've just been non-stop on getting the Dreamcast up to speed. I got the console with composite cables, which work with my TV, but if I'm to get the best experience I wanted the best video output. I don't have an OSSC so I'm forgoing that approach; perhaps one day I will circle back and get one if the retro console collection grows. I also don't have VGA cable for the Dreamcast nor an input for it on my TV, so I'm also not able to show that comparison. Composite will be processed 
So I have a series of 2880x2160 images that I have imported to virtualdub, and I want to export as h264 or h265 with near lossless quality in 10 bit color 4:4:4. I Spent most of yesterday learning how to to this, but the encoder I used was x264.exe. I finally got a large output file with the quality I wanted, and it plays, but I could not load it in my editor, nor any free video converter. My question is twofold. what encoder SHOULD I use to get a usable file for my editor with nearly lossless. I have an Amiga 1200, and a MISTer. I have a few nice CRTs, and I have a Sony DSC1024G Scan Converter to bring the two together. Both the Amiga and the MISTer will output 15kHz video and most monitors can't handle this. The DSC1024G is an old but good piece of professional equipment that was staggeringly expensive when new but now can be picked up for less than the cost of alternatives like the OSSC (when you can even get one).
